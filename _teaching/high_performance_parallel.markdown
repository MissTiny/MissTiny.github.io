description: Diverse aspects of parallel programming and high-performance computing are covered. The core of this class is on basic parallel programming using standard libraries such as OpenMP for multicore processors, CUDA for GPUs, and MPI for distributed systems. Important concepts such as cache locality and data dependence are introduced as the fundamentals for understanding and optimizing performance. Programming examples and assignments are from applications in the areas of data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.
